# MLCad #
  1. Doesn't like nested MPD files.
  1. Weird drag-and-duplicate mouse gesture that I dislike and don't know how to turn off.
  1. Parts lose focus when pressing toolbar buttons (i.e. rotate).
  1. After changing views the model you're looking at may no longer be visible, requiring you to locate it again by panning the camera. This is a big nusiance for large models since the redraw rate is very slow.
  1. The camera controls for the 3D isometric view are VERY crappy. This is the program's worst feature, IMO. I wish MLCAD had LDView's camera movement controls inside the 3D view window.

  1. Can't specify camera location/look at.
  1. Camera movement controls are way too fast when viewing large models.
  1. No orthographic camera mode.

  1. Doesn't like Datsville at all. Can't get it to load the complete model.
  1. Model loading is extremely slow.
  1. Can't zoom in/out very far.
  1. Vague error message about duplicate parts. Could potentially pop up very often given the size of Datsville.
  1. Can't seem to find the "b" parts.

  1. Wonky camera controls.
