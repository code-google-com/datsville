I forgot which order these parts should be copied in. I.e. should Tore's parts 
be copied first and then overridden by my "old" parts and again by my "new" 
parts? It's been so long since I've worked on them that I forgot.

Not sure if I should remove edge lines from parts. For instance "box.dat".

All my boxed parts are missing their "*.nfo" files, so they cannot be used by 
Tore's ldboxer program.
