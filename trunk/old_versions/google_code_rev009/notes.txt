- The library model should probably be repurposed as a high school or factory 
  since it seems too big for a library compared to the other buildings.
- Building 58 has a lower storey that is being clipped by the ground.
- Need to find space and locations for the bus stops.
- A bike path across the river based on the design by Jacob Sparre Anderson 
  would be nice.
