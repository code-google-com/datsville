#summary Notes regarding software

= MLCad =
  # Doesn't like nested MPD files.
  # Weird drag-and-duplicate mouse gesture that I dislike and don't know how to turn off.
  # Parts lose focus when pressing toolbar buttons (i.e. rotate).
  # After changing views the model you're looking at may no longer be visible, requiring you to locate it again by panning the camera. This is a big nusiance for large models since the redraw rate is very slow.
  # The camera controls for the 3D isometric view are VERY crappy. This is the program's worst feature, IMO. I wish MLCAD had LDView's camera movement controls inside the 3D view window.

= LDView =
  # Can't specify camera location/look at.
  # Camera movement controls are way too fast when viewing large models.
  # No orthographic camera mode.

= SR 3D Builder =
  # Doesn't like Datsville at all. Can't get it to load the complete model.
  # Model loading is extremely slow.
  # Can't zoom in/out very far.
  # Vague error message about duplicate parts. Could potentially pop up very often given the size of Datsville.
  # Can't seem to find the "b" parts.

= LDCad =
  # Wonky camera controls.
