#summary List of things to do.

= Project =

  # Get permission from the original authors for the various models. (CC-BY-SA is preferred.)
  # Determine if any additional model/sub-model organizational steps are needed.
  # Create a collection of helper scripts to make it easy to generate renderings, animations, panoramas and so forth using POV-Ray and/or other software packages.
  # Streamline the model submission process so that new content can be added quickly and easily.
  # Create one or more virtual Web tours, or an interactive isometric map like a cross between SimCity and Google Maps.
  # A lot of sub-models are "inlined", which is a bad thing as they are better left as MPDs. Need to obtain the original models or reverse this inlining if possible. (Caveat - MLCAD doesn't like nested MPDs however.)

= Models =

  # Strip all vehicles and pedestrians from the building models and add them to the traffic layer.
  # Add driveways that slope smoothly into the roads. (See Mike Gallagher's examples.)
  # But how do I build driveways if the adjacent road section lies at an incline?
  # Traffic layer needs to be gone over again to make sure cars are sitting correctly on the ground instead of floating above, sitting in the grass, etc.
  # Figure out the best way to implement sloped roads.
  # Building 58 has a lower storey that is being clipped by the ground.
  # The white camper in Tore's "pending" folder is a very nice model. It would be great if we could use it.
  # <s>Replace petrol station's baseplates with SNOT roads?</s>
  # <s>The parking lots near the university and apartment complex are ugly and need to be redesigned.</s>
  # The cell tower looks more like a tornado siren. Rename?
  # Make sure all "boxed" parts have edge lines. It's possible Tore's parts all had edge lines, and I overrode them with my own edgeline-less parts mistakenly.
  # Need to consider again which versions of Mike Gallagher's SNOT roads to use because he has created several. The latest versions have blue wheelchair accessible ramps.
  # <s>Baseball players are missing from the baseball field.</s>
  # The grocery store needs some parking spaces.
  # <s>Not sure what "t04i1304.dat" and "t04o1304.dat" are for. Can they be safely deleted?</s>
  # <s>Why are "dx900.dat" and "dx901.dat" needed? Also "look_at.dat".</s>
  # Datsville has a radio tower, but no radio station.
  # Add sewer drains to SNOT roads.
  # <s>Replace any road baseplates that still might exist with SNOT roads.</s>
  # Update myboxer's "box_list.ini" if possible.
  # The city needs fire hydrants.
  # There are still some TLG-designed models that unfortunately need to be removed.
  # I am thinking about changing the asphalt color from black to dark gray, and the sidewalk color from white to light gray. Those colors look a little more urban. But is that what we want?
  # I would like to add a model of a giant tree.
  # Houses need bushes, gardens, etc. around them.
  # Baseball field needs spotlights and a fence surrounding the outfield.
  # One-way streets need two neighboring traffic signals at intersections since both lanes are going in the same direction.
  # Make sure streetlamps don't block driveways.
  # Make sure sreetlamps can be ratcheted to the correct angle when placed on sloping streets.
  # All minifigures should be unique. Even players on the baseball teams.
