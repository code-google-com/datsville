#summary List of things to do.

= Project =

  # Get permission from the original authors for the various models. (CC-BY-SA is preferred.)
  # Determine if any additional model/sub-model organizational steps are needed.
  # Create a collection of helper scripts to make it easy to generate renderings, animations, panoramas and so forth using POV-Ray and/or other software packages.
  # Streamline the model submission process so that new content can be added quickly and easily.
  # Create one or more virtual Web tours, or an interactive isometric map like a cross between SimCity and Google Maps.

= Models =

  # Strip all vehicles and pedestrians from building models and add them to the traffic layer.
  # Add driveways that slope smoothly into the roads. See Mike Gallagher's examples. (But how do I build driveways if the road section lies at an incline?)
  # <s>Traffic layer needs to be gone over again to make sure cars and pedestrians are standing correctly on the ground, sitting in the grass, etc.</s>
  # Figure out the best way to implement sloped roads and heightfield terrain.
  # Building 58 has a lower storey that is being clipped by the ground.
  # The white camper in Tore's "pending" folder is a very nice model. It would be great if we could use it.
  # <s>Replace petrol station's baseplates with SNOT roads?</s>
  # <s>The parking lots near the university and apartment complex are ugly and need to be redesigned.</s>
  # The cell tower looks more like a tornado siren. Repurpose and rename?
  # Make sure all "boxed" parts have edge lines. It's possible Tore's parts all had edge lines, but I overrode them with my own edgeline-less parts mistakenly.
  # Need to consider again which versions of Mike Gallagher's SNOT roads to use because he has created several. The latest versions have blue wheelchair accessible ramps for instance.
  # <s>Baseball players are missing from the baseball field.</s>
  # <s>The grocery store needs some parking spaces.</s>
  # <s>Not sure what "t04i1304.dat" and "t04o1304.dat" are for. Can they be safely deleted?</s>
  # <s>Why are "dx900.dat" and "dx901.dat" needed? Also "look_at.dat".</s>
  # Datsville has a radio tower, but no radio station building.
  # Add sewer drains to SNOT roads.
  # <s>Replace any road baseplates that still might exist with SNOT roads.</s>
  # <s>Update myboxer's "box_list.ini" if possible.</s>
  # <s>The city needs fire hydrants.</s>
  # <s>There are still some TLG-designed models that unfortunately need to be removed.</s>
  # I am thinking about changing the asphalt color from black to dark gray, and the sidewalk color from white to light gray. Those colors would look a little more urban, but I'm not sure that's what we want.
  # I would like to add a model of a giant tree.
  # Houses need bushes, gardens, flowers, etc. around them.
  # There need to be more minifigures walking around or inside buildings. There need to be more minifigs in general.
  # Baseball field needs spotlights and a fence surrounding the outfield.
  # One-way streets need two traffic signals facing the same direction at intersections since both lanes are going in the same direction.
  # Make sure streetlamps don't block driveways.
  # Make sure sreetlamps can be ratcheted to the correct angle when placed on sloping inclines.
  # All minifigures and vehicles should use unique models. Even players on the baseball teams.
  # Lower shopping center parking lot by 8 LDU. Also, pizza place.
  # <s>A lot of sub-models are "inlined", which is a bad thing as they are better left as MPDs. Need to obtain the original models or reverse this inlining if possible. (Caveat - MLCAD doesn't like nested MPDs however.)</s>
  # <s>Streets are a major PITA to edit. Need to split them into rectangular "cells".</s>
  # I'm not real happy with block 8 where the university once stood. It needs to be made more parklike.
  # Maybe make areas between shops and sidewalks white instead of gray.
  # There may be too many streetlights in Datsville. I should at least try to use single-bulb lamps instead of double.
  # <s>Train tracks should be bumped up a little more in height.</s>
  # <s>I'm not real happy with how the city depot and airport turned out. The depot is maybe too large and the airport too small.</s>
  # Streets should be broken down into smaller modules for crosswalks, road markers, other road paint. This will need to be done when implementing driveways anyway.
  # <s>Maybe make two railroad tracks for the whole length through the city.</s>
  # The garden on the roof of the office building isn't very attractive. It needs to be redone.
  # The airport is too close to the city. Move it farther away and have a road lead up to it.
