#summary List of things to do.

= Project =

  # Get permission from the original authors for the various models. (CC-BY-SA is preferred.)
  # Determine if any additional model/sub-model organizational steps are needed.
  # Create a collection of helper scripts to make it easy to generate renderings, animations, panoramas and so forth using POV-Ray and/or other software packages.
  # Streamline the model submission process so that new content can be added quickly and easily.
  # Create one or more virtual Web tours.

= Models =

  # Strip all vehicles and pedestrians from the building models and add them to the traffic layer.
  # Add driveways that slope smoothly into the roads. (See Mike Gallagher's examples.)
  # Add wheelchair ramps to SNOT road sidewalks. (See Mike Gallagher's examples.)
  # Traffic layer needs to be gone over again to make sure cars are sitting correctly on the ground instead of floating above it or sitting in the grass, etc.
  # Figure out the best way to implement sloped roads.
  # Add the construction vehicles I created for the Mining Facility.
  # Building 58 has a lower storey that is being clipped by the ground.
  # The white camper in Tore's "pending" folder is a very nice model. I would like to use it.
  # Replace petrol station's baseplates with SNOT roads?
  # Radio tower should be a building model, not an infrastructure model.
  # The parking lot near the university is ugly and needs to be redesigned.
  # The cell tower looks more like a tornado siren. Rename?
  # Figure out how to split the terrain model into 16 parts.
  # Make sure all "boxed" parts have edge lines. It's possible Tore's parts all had edge lines, and I overrode them with my own edgeless parts.
  # SNOT roads can be optimized to use fewer bricks. Need to decide which version of Mike Gallagher's bricks to use because he has created several. See "snotroad_curveblanknocross.ldr" for an example.
  # Baseball players are missing from the baseball field.
  # The grocery store needs some parking spaces.
