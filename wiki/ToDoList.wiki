= To-do list =

  # Get permission from the original authors for the various models. (CC-BY-SA is preferred.)
  # Use the SVN repository for what it was designed to do instead of simply uploading file archives.
  # Documentation is VERY out of date.
  # Determine if any additional model/sub-model organizational steps are needed.
  # Create a collection of helper scripts to make it easy to generate renderings, animations, panoramas and so forth using POV-Ray and/or other software packages.
  # Streamline the model submission process so that new content can be added quickly and easily.
  # Create one or more virtual Web tours.
  # Find suitable web hosting for all of the above.
  # Upload and maintain the latest and most complete library of "boxed" parts here.
