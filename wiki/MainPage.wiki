#summary About the Datsville Relicense Project.

= Introduction =

Datsville is a Lego-inspired city created by users using the LDraw suite of Lego CAD software. The project has been around for about ten years now, but has languished somewhat in recent years due to lack of contributions and activity. The goal of this project is to re-license models using a modern, open license, as well as to actively manage old and new submissions.


= Details =

Since this project is brand new, the main things that need to be done at this moment are:

  # Get permission to relicense models from the original model authors.
  # Determine what (if any) organizational steps need to be taken to get models in a state where they are ready to render into new scenes, animations and so forth.

Once that is completed hopefully we can develop some ready-to-use tools for people to develop the scenes they want.

The preferred licenses are:

  # LGPL for programming code (POV-Ray, etc.)
  # CC-BY-SA for content (LDraw models, etc.)

New submissions are of course always welcome! :)
