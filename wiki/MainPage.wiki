#summary About the Datsville relicense project

= Introduction =

Datsville is a Lego-inspired city generated by users using the LDraw suite of Lego CAD software. The project has been around for about ten years now, but has languished somewhat in recent years due to lack of contributions and activity. The goal of this project is also to re-license models using a modern, open license.


= Details =

Since this project is brand new, the main things that need to be done are:

  # Get permission to relicense models from the original model authors.
  # Determine what (if any) organizational steps need to be taken to get models in a state where they are ready to be used by users to render new scenes, animations and so forth quickly and easily.

Once these steps are completed we can develop ready-to-use scripts for people to create the scenes they want.
