#summary Instructions on what to do in POVRay.

The POVRay scripts are in "trunk\povray". After converting Datsville using L3P version 1.4, delete any camera and light statements, and delete all the color and material definitions in the "Defines" section, replacing them with a reference to "ldr_wrapper_1.4.inc". Render the scene at 6144 x 3072 pixels. This will produce the isometric image I use in my town maps. You'll need a lot of RAM, but it won't take a lot of time to render once it's done parsing.
