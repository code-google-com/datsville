The only 3D converter that worked reliably for me is Marc Klein's stl2dat. This converter is also available in Mikeheide's LETGUI package, with a nice GUI shell and a bunch of other LDraw tools. Attached your converted mesh. What I did:
- open .obj in meshlab and converted to stl ASCII mode (uncheck "binary")
- convert to .dat using stl2dat with default options. Notice that stl2dat made a mess with conditional lines because the mesh is tiny (1 unit wide -> converted to 1 ldu). So, convert again using "raw" option.
- Upscale the result in MLCad (I used a 25x scaling), this is the raw mesh as attached.
- Processed through Edger2 (included in LETGUI) to create conditional lines
- processed through rectifier to convert planar triangle pairs to quads (look better).

After scaling, you need to round everything to integers. I think the simplest is to open the file in LDDP. Change decimal accuracy to 0 (tools -> options -> configurations values tab -> editor behavior subtab -> position decimal accuracy = 0). Then select all (ctrl A) and round everything (ctrl D).

Edit: this changes to integers height AND x-z coordinates. I have to simple way to do that only on y.
