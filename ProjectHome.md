# Introduction #

Datsville is a Lego-inspired city created 15 years ago by users of LUGNET using the LDraw suite of Lego CAD software. The goal of this project is to re-license models using a modern, open license, as well as to actively manage old and new submissions.

# Details #

Since this project is brand new, the main things that need to be done at this moment are:

  1. Get permission to relicense models from the original model authors.
  1. Determine what (if any) organizational steps need to be taken to get models in a state where they are ready to render into new scenes, animations and so forth.

Once that is completed hopefully we can develop some ready-to-use tools for people to develop the scenes they want.

The preferred licenses are:

  1. LGPL for programming code (POV-Ray, etc.)
  1. CC-BY-SA for artistic content (LDraw models, etc.)

New submissions are of course always welcome! :)
