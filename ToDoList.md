# Project #

  1. Get permission from the original authors for the various models. (CC-BY-SA is preferred.)
  1. Determine if any additional model/sub-model organizational steps are needed.
  1. Create a collection of helper scripts to make it easy to generate renderings, animations, panoramas and so forth using POV-Ray and/or other software packages.
  1. Streamline the model submission process so that new content can be added quickly and easily.
  1. Create one or more virtual Web tours, a role-playing game, or an interactive isometric map like a cross between SimCity and Google Maps.
  1. <s>Experiment with different types of oblique perspective.</s>

# Models #

  1. Strip all vehicles and pedestrians from building models and add them to the traffic layer. [ongoing](ongoing.md)
  1. Create driveways that slope smoothly into the roads. See Mike Gallagher's examples. (But how do I build driveways if the road section lies at an incline?)
  1. <s>Traffic layer needs to be gone over again to make sure cars and pedestrians are standing correctly on the ground, sitting in the grass, etc.</s>
  1. Figure out the best way to implement sloped roads and heightfield terrain.
  1. Make sure streetlamps can be ratcheted to the correct angle when placed on sloping inclines. [e.g. sloped roads and heightfields]
  1. Building 58 has a lower storey that is being clipped by the ground.
  1. Replace petrol station's baseplates with SNOT roads? [with MG](consult.md)
  1. <s>The parking lots near the university and apartment complex are ugly and need to be redesigned.</s>
  1. The cell tower looks more like a tornado siren. Repurpose and rename?
  1. Make sure all "boxed" parts have edge lines. It's possible Tore Eriksson's boxed parts all had edge lines, and that I overrode them with my own edgeline-less parts mistakenly.
  1. Need to consider again which versions of Mike Gallagher's SNOT roads to use. He has created several designs. The latest versions have blue wheelchair accessible ramps for instance.
  1. <s>Baseball players are missing from the baseball field.</s>
  1. <s>The grocery store needs some parking spaces.</s>
  1. <s>Not sure what "t04i1304.dat" and "t04o1304.dat" are for. Can they be safely deleted?</s>
  1. <s>Why are "dx900.dat" and "dx901.dat" needed? Also "look_at.dat".</s>
  1. Datsville has a radio tower, but no radio station building.
  1. <s>Add sewer drains to SNOT roads.</s>
  1. <s>Replace any road baseplates that still might exist with SNOT roads.</s>
  1. <s>Update myboxer's "box_list.ini" if possible.</s>
  1. <s>The city needs fire hydrants.</s>
  1. <s>There are still some TLG-designed models that unfortunately need to be removed.</s>
  1. I am thinking about changing the asphalt color from black to dark gray, and the sidewalk color from white to light gray. Those colors would look a little more urban, but I'm not sure that's desirable.
  1. I would like to add a model of a giant tree.
  1. Yards need bushes, gardens, flowers, etc. around them.
  1. Add fences around yards?
  1. There need to be more minifigures walking around or inside buildings. There need to be more minifigs in general.
  1. Baseball field needs spotlights and a fence surrounding the outfield.
  1. One-way streets need two traffic signals facing the same direction at intersections since both lanes are going in the same direction.
  1. All minifigures and vehicles should use unique models. Even players on the baseball teams.
  1. <s>A lot of sub-models are "inlined", which is a bad thing as they are better left as MPDs. Need to obtain the original models or reverse this inlining if possible. [Caveat: MLCAD doesn't like nested MPDs.]</s>
  1. <s>The streets layer is a major PITA to edit because it has so many parts. Need to split it into square "cells".</s>
  1. I'm not real happy with block 8 where the university once stood. It needs to be made more parklike.
  1. Maybe make areas between shops and sidewalks white instead of gray.
  1. There may be too many streetlights in Datsville. I should at least try to use single-bulb lamps instead of double.
  1. <s>Train tracks should be bumped up a little more in height.</s>
  1. <s>I'm not real happy with how the city depot and airport turned out. The depot is maybe too large and the airport too small.</s>
  1. Streets should be broken down into smaller modular sections to make it possible to add crosswalks, road markers, and other road paint. [will need to be done when implementing driveways anyway.](This.md)
  1. <s>Maybe make two railroad tracks for the whole length through the city.</s>
  1. The garden on the roof of the office building isn't very attractive.
  1. The airport is too close to the city. Move it farther away and have a road lead up to it.
  1. Maybe create a new model category "furniture" to make the creation of building interiors easier. [started, but needs to be expanded]
  1. <s>Some email addresses appear within the models themselves. Try and see if the missing authors can be reached via them.</s>
  1. Maybe remove email addresses from models entirely and rely on contact list alone.
  1. <s>Make sure model filenames are lowcaps since the file system may be case-sensitive.</s>
  1. <s>Several models still have inlined sub-models that need to be turned back into proper LDR sub-models.</s>
  1. Each model and sub-model needs to have the proper software license attached to it.
  1. <s>The tag 'Unofficial Model' needs to be replaced with 'Unofficial Datsville Model' in each model and sub-model.</s>
  1. Add missing titles to sub-models in MPD files.
  1. Some author tags in sub-models remain blank and should be filled.
  1. Buildings with open backs should really be closed.
  1. Add light sources to all models for night-time renders.
  1. <s>Adjust the scene so that y = 0 is at the grass/sidewalk surface instead of the road surface.</s>
  1. <s>The town hall uses illegal baseplates for floors.</s>
  1. <s>Make the bridges 8 bricks wider.</s>
  1. <s>Bike paths need to be moved a little to align with the tile grid.</s>
  1. <s>Fire hydrants, trash cans and bus stops need to be aligned with the tile grid.</s>
  1. Fire hydrants, trash cans and bus stops need to be placed individually instead of groups in case they are blocking driveways.
  1. <s>Move fire hydrants etc. to overlayer?</s>
  1. <s>Move streetsigns to overlayer.</s>
  1. <s>Copy temple trees to a new type of tree.</s>

  1. <s>building_040_lookouttower has people in it.</s>
  1. <s>All minifig animations need to be redone because the back leg is not rotated correctly.</s>
  1. <s>Block 6 base needs to be edited so that building 21 can be lowered 8 LDU.</s>
  1. <s>High school needs to be split into top and bottom layers.</s>
  1. <s>Supermarket needs to be realigned with the ground grid.</s>
  1. <s>Radio tower is sitting on a green block instead of concrete.</s>

  1. [tricky](tricky.md) building\_017\_nationalbank has people in it.
  1. [tricky](tricky.md) building\_031\_carriagehouse has people in it.
  1. building\_002\_townhall.mpd has a person in it.
  1. building\_002\_townhall.mpd intersects street lamps and trashcans because it is too wide.
  1. vehicle\_054\_monaro has a person standing outside the car instead of sitting in it.
  1. Blue apartments need showers/tubs.
  1. <s>Arrow road construction signs need to be moved to the streets overlayer.</s>
  1. Check the gridded ground layer for misaligned building models. [ongoing](ongoing.md)
  1. <s>Shopping center and pizza place parking lots should be converted to SNOT like the other roads.</s>
  1. <s>Shopping center should be raised by 8 LDU.</s>
  1. Driveways need to be aligned with the tile grid. [ongoing](ongoing.md)
  1. Make sure trees are positioned properly on the studs under them. [ongoing](ongoing.md)
  1. <s>Parking lot areas should be SNOT like MG's SNOT roads.</s>
  1. Maybe replace building\_024\_andershouse.ldr since it is out-of-scale. But you could argue the post office is out-of-scale too.
  1. Lower buildings with ground tiles so the ground is flush with the grass. [ongoing](ongoing.md)
  1. Airplane hangar should be aligned with baseplate grid.
  1. Replace one of the two bridges with another that is different from the first two.
  1. Rocky baseplates need to be thickened by 8 LDU so they are the same height as the areas surrounding them.
  1. Gas station could use a kerosene pump.
  1. Office building should have solar panels instead of a garden on the roof.
  1. The train looks like it's electrically powered. Need power lines.
  1. Curved road tiles should maybe have a narrower sidewalk that follows the contour of the curve, and leaves the rest as grass.
  1. Should maybe create custom SNOT roads for the area around the Town Hall since the building is so large.
