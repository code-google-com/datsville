This is an old carriage house that has been converted into a fire station. Vehicles can pull into and park in spaces on the bottom floor. There is an emergency medical facility and lounge on the top floor.The building could probably be repurposed since there is already a fire station in Datsville. I also want to change the red brick to dark gray. There are some TLC vehicles that need to be removed since they are copyrighted.
